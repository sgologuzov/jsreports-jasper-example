Data sources for jsreports are JSON or CSV data.  You can\npoint to a data source on a server by its URL, or you can provide actual data as a literal JavaScript array.  See \n\nWorking with Data\n for more details and examples.\n\n\nTo get started with a simple data source, copy and paste the following code.  This will be a simple data source with just three rows of data.\n\n\nvar orderData = [{\n    \"userId\": \"1X39AN4Z92Y\",\n    \"userName\": \"John Smith\",\n    \"accountType\": \"INDIVIDUAL\",\n    \"orderTotal\": 19.95,\n    \"orderDate\": \"2016-02-24\"\n},{\n    \"userId\": \"1AC43L30HR8\",\n    \"userName\": \"Alison Jones\",\n    \"accountType\": \"BUSINESS\",\n    \"orderTotal\": 180.50,\n    \"orderDate\": \"2016-02-25\"\n},{\n    \"userId\": \"1CM499NA94R\",\n    \"userName\": \"Becky Sanderson\",\n    \"accountType\": \"BUSINESS\",\n    \"orderTotal\": 85.00,\n    \"orderDate\": \"2016-02-27\"\n}];\n\n// A schema is used to assist the report designer and report engine to know\n// about the data types used in the data source.\nvar orderSchema = {\n    fields: [{\n        name: \"userId\",\n        type: \"text\"\n    },{\n        name: \"userName\",\n        type: \"text\"\n    },{\n        name: \"accountType\",\n        type: \"text\"\n    },{\n        name: \"orderTotal\",\n        type: \"number\"\n    },{\n        name: \"orderDate\",\n        type: \"date\"\n    }]\n};\n\nvar dataSource = {\n    id: \"orders\",   // Internal reference ID\n    name: \"Orders\",  // Data source name shown to report designer\n    data: orderData,\n    schema: orderSchema\n};\n\n\n\n\nNow, we'll define a very simple report that uses this data.  You can use the report\ncomponent to create reports, but here we'll use the \n\nreport builder API\n \nto assemble a report definition in code.\n\n\n// Create a report definition\nvar report = jsreports.createReport()\n    .data('orders') // The report will look for a data source with ID \"orders\"\n    .groupBy('accountType', 'accountType', 'desc')\n        .header(0.35)\n            .text('[accountType] Accounts:')\n        .footer(0.5)\n            .text('Total: [SUM(orderTotal)]', 2, 0, 2, 0.25, {\n                pattern: '$#,##0.00',\n                align: 'right',\n                bold: true\n            })\n    .detail()\n        .text('[userName]')\n        .text('[orderDate]', 1.75, 0, 1, 0.25, {\n            pattern: 'M/D/YY'\n        })\n        .text('[orderTotal]', 3, 0, 1, 0.25, {\n            pattern: '$#,##0.00',\n            align: 'right'\n        })\n    .done();\n\n// Render the report\njsreports.render({\n    report_def: report,\n    target: $('body').css('min-height', '500px'),\n    datasets: [ dataSource ]\n});\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run this code, you should get a result like the following:\n\n\n\n\nNext, check out the \nexamples\n to see how to implement other types of reports.",

Each report definition specifies the ID of its primary data source, and jsreports looks at the corresponding data set when rendering the report.\n\n\nData sources can be either JSON or CSV format.\n\n\nJSON data\n\n\njsreports can consume dynamic data served over a REST API, or literal JS objects defined in code.  If you need to transform data before handing it to jsreports, it's best to provide data to the report using the \ndata config property\n of \njsreports.render\n and \njsreports.export\n.\n\n\nBelow is an example of a JSON data feed.\n\n\n[{\n    \"person_id\": \"1x39an4a92y\",\n    \"person_name\": \"John P. Smith\",\n    \"hours\": 4.75\n},{\n    \"person_id\": \"1ac43L30hR8\",\n    \"person_name\": \"Alison Jones\",\n    \"hours\": 8.5\n}]\n\n\n\n\nThis is a tabular format represented as an array of row objects.  The snippet above\ncorresponds to a table like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperson_id\n\n\nperson_name\n\n\nhours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x39an4a92y\n\n\nJohn P. Smith\n\n\n4.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1ac43L30hR8\n\n\nAlison Jones\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSV data\n\n\nHere is an example of CSV (comma-separated) text data that represents the same table shown above:\n\n\nperson_id,person_name,hours\n1x39an4a92y,John P. Smith,4.75\n1ac43L30hR8,Alison Jones,8.5\n\n\n\n\nTo define a CSV data source, set the \nformat\n\nconfig property:\n\n\n{\n  id: \"sp500\",\n  name: \"S\n 500 Companies\",\n  url: \"data/sp500.csv\",\n  format: \"csv\",\n  hasHeaderRow: true,\n  schema_url: \"data/sp500-schema.json\"\n}\n\n\n\nData source schemas\n\n\nYou should also define a schema for each data source.  While it's possible to render\nreports without a schema, the schema is required in order to use the designer, and it's\na good idea to use the same data source definitions everywhere.\nThe schema describes the columns and their data types.  \n\n\nThe most basic schema is an object with a \"fields\" property, whose value is an array\nof field definitions, each having a \"name\" and \"type\" property.  For examples, see the \nschemas included with the examples in the jsreports distribution.\n\n\nHere is a sample schema for the data source shown above:\n\n\n{\n    \"fields\": [{\n        \"name\": \"person_id\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n    },{\n        \"name\": \"person_name\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n    },{\n        \"name\": \"hours\",\n        \"type\": \"number\"\n    }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nValid data types\n\n\nThe following are the data types allowed for fields in the schema, and examples of their\nexpected representation in the corresponding data source feed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData type\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\n\"John P. Smith\", \"Text \\\"with quotes\\\"\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber\n\n\n37.56, \"37.56\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\n\"2015-05-19\", \"2015-05-19 14:22:36\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboolean\n\n\ntrue, false\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Joined data sources\n\n\nYou can join two other data sources together to create a joined data source with its own ID,\nthat can then be used as the basis for a report.  The following example creates a joined\ndata source from two other data sources:\n\n\n{\n    \"fields\": [{\n        \"id\": \"states\",\n        \"url\": \"states.json\"\n    },{\n        \"id\": \"customers\",\n        \"url\": \"customers.json\"\n    },{\n        \"id\": \"states-and-customers\",\n        \"join\": {\n            \"type\": \"left\",\n            \"left\": \"states\",\n            \"leftKey\": \"state\",\n            \"right\": \"customers\",\n            \"rightKey\": \"headquartersState\"\n        }\n    }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the left data source is a table of states and the right is a table of\ncompanies.  leftKey and rightKey are the field names from each data source.  Rows are joined\nwhen the values in those fields are the same between both data sources.\n\n\nThis example uses a left join, meaning that all records from the left data source will be\npresent in the joined results, regardless of whether any records from the right source match that row.\nTo only return joined rows where both sides are present (inner join), use type: \"inner\".\n\n\nReport definitions\n\n\nReports are stored in a simple JSON text format.  Look in the examples directory of the\njsreports package for sample report definition files (example: grouping-report-def.json).\n\n\nManaging saved reports\n\n\njsreports includes everything needed to allow users to define and run their\nown reports.  As the developer, you'll need to provide a way to save the report\ndefinitions between sessions.\n\n\nThat means that you will need to load the correct set of reports for the current user's session\nusing your own criteria, and you will need to determine a method to save the plain-text report\ndefinition on your server when the user edits it in the designer.\n\n\nSaving report definitions on a server\n\n\nWhen the user clicks Save in the designer, jsreports will fire an event that you can listen for.\nIn your event handler, you can send the report definition to your server and store it in a database.\n\n\nExample:\n\n// Note: designer is a variable that has been initialized \n//    as in step 3 of Getting Started, above.\n$(designer).on(\"save\", function(evt, reportdef) {\n    // reportdef is a string containing the report \n    //    definition in JSON format\n    // currentUserID is an example variable that would \n    //    identify the current user\n    $.post(\"/save-report.php\", { \n      report: reportdef, \n      userid: currentUserID \n    }, function(data) {\n        alert(\"Report saved on server.\");\n    });\n});\n\n\n\nRunning reports\n\n\nIf you have a report definition in a string variable, either loaded from your server or captured in the\nSave event of the designer, you can run it (generate the report output in HTML format) by using the\nfollowing code:\n\n\n// reportDef is the string containing the report \n//    definition in JSON form\n// dataSources is a Javascript array of data sources, \n//    exactly the same as passed in step 3 of \n//    Getting Started, above\n// target is a div element on the page into which \n//    the report will be rendered\njsreports.render({\n    report_def: reportDef,\n    target: $(\"#report-output\"),\n    datasets: dataSources\n});\n\n\n\n\nImages\n\n\nYou can provide a selection of images for your users to embed in reports.  Just pass an \"images\" configuration\nproperty when instantiating a designer, like this:\n\n\n// images is an array of image definition objects, \n// with name and url properties\nvar designer = new jsreports.Designer({\n    images: [{\n        name: \"ACME logo\",\n        url: \"/images/acme-logo.jpg\"\n    },{\n        name: \"Product photo\",\n        url: \"/images/product1.jpg\"\n    }],\n    /* ... */\n});\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n: In order for images to appear in browser-generated PDF reports, the URL of the image must be on the same\ndomain as the page from which the report is generated, due to browser cross-origin security policy.  Using relative\nURLs, as in the code snippet above, is one way to solve this problem.\n\n\nFonts and PDF\n\n\nPDF's built-in fonts do not support the character range required to display all non-English alphabets.  Therefore,\nby default jsreports attempts to embed and use the font \nRoboto\n \n(from Google) as the default font when generating a PDF.\n\n\njsreports looks for the Roboto font under the /fonts path relative to the jsreports.libraryPath variable.\n\n\nIf you include jsreports in your page via a \nscript\n tag, jsreports may be able to infer the libraryPath correctly.\nIf you find that international characters are not appearing properly in your PDF, try manually setting the library path\nas follows:\n\n\njsreports.libraryPath = '/path/to/jsreports';\n\n\n\n\nThe path should be to a folder containing the \"media\" and \"fonts\" subfolders from the jsreports distribution.\n\n\nYou may also need to check the network requests being made during PDF rendering to verify that requests are being made \nto load Roboto.\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nSee the \nAPI Reference\n for details on available classes and methods.\n\n\nWorking with Jasper Reports\n\n\nSee \nHow to use jsreports with Jasper Reports\n.\n\n\nMore coming soon\n\n\njsreports is new and we're still adding to our documentation.

Do that by listening for the designer's \"save\" event and then using the .getJasperReport() and .toJRXML() methods:\n\n\n// Listen for save event\nvar JasperReportDef = jsreports.integrations.jasper.JasperReportDef;\n// This code would come immediately after instantiating a jsreports.Designer\n$(designer).on(\"save\", function(evt, def) {\n    var jrxml = designer.getJasperReport().toJRXML();\n    // ... send JRXML to server\n});\n\n\n\n\nSetting the data fields for the report\n\n\nYou can specify the data source schema for the report by calling setSchema on the JasperReportDef object, like this:\n\n\nvar def = new jsreports.integrations.jasper.JasperReportDef();\ndef.setSchema({\n    fields: [{\n      name: 'OrderNumber',\n      type: 'number'\n    },{\n      name: 'Date',\n      type: 'date'\n    },{\n      name: 'Value',\n      type: 'number'\n    },{\n      name: 'Product',\n      type: 'text'\n    }]\n});\n\n\n\n\nIf you do this before opening the designer, the designer will have access to these fields for use in the report.\n\n\nWhen you use fromJRXML to read an existing JRXML report, the embedded schema (fields) defined in the JRXML will be used unless you call setSchema() to override them.\n\n\nJasper feature support\n\n\nBelow is a list of currently supported features.

Not all buttons are always present, and in fact the\nheader bar itself may not be present, depending on how the developer has configured the designer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport setup panel\n\nContains all parameters that define the report structure, for example, which data source to use, grouping,\nand sorting of records within the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport canvas\n\nThe visual designer area where you arrange elements that make up the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement toolbar\n\nContains properties of the currently selected element, allowing you to customize each element.  Only visible\nwhen a single element is selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport setup\n\n\nSelecting a data source\n\n\nIn this selector, choose which data source provides\nthe records needed by your report.  If you need to drill-down into another, linked data source (for example,\nyou want to list branch offices and then for each branch office, obtain the employees for that office from\na different data source), start with the outermost data source (in this example, the branch office list).\nYou'll be able to define the drill-down data source separately in the Grouping section.\nData sources are defined by the application developer.\n\n\nFiltering the data source\n\n\nYou can restrict your report to use only some of the records from the chosen data source.  In the filters\nsection just below the Data Source selector, add one or more filters.\n\n\nTo edit an existing filter, hover over the filter and look for the \"edit\" and \"delete\" icons on the right.\n\n\nFor each filter, specify first the field in the data source containing the values that will be filtered,\nthen the type of comparison that will be done, and finally the value to filter against.\n\n\nTo filter against a report input (see the section on defining inputs), use square brackets containing a\nquestion mark followed by the input name that you defined, for example: \n[?MyFilterName]\n\n\n\n\nLevels and Groups\n\n\nThis area allows you to create sub-groupings of records.  You can define nested groupings if needed, \nstarting with\nthe outermost grouping and working inward.  Changing groupings will affect the structure of the report\nshown in the canvas.\n\n\nAdding a grouping\n\n\nClick the \"add grouping\" button to add a grouping.\n\n\nThe first, top-level grouping that you add will always use records from the report's base data source (chosen\nby the Data Source selector).  You'll need to choose which field in the data source contains the values that\nwill be grouped.\n\n\nYou can choose the order in which the resulting groups will be arranged.  By default, this will match the\ngrouping field.  For example, if you selected to group by the State field for branch offices, by default the\ngroups will be ordered alphabetically by the value in the State field.  You can change this ordering by\nselecting a different field in the \"arranged by\" selector for the grouping.\n\n\nNote that if you select a different ordering, you should choose a field that has the same value for\neach of the grouping\nvalues, because if there are multiple values in the \"arrange by\" field for each value in the grouping field,\nit is not clear which should be used to order that grouping.\n\n\nFinally, you can choose whether this grouping level should have a header and footer.  Use the checkboxes to\nturn on and off the header and footer.  You'll see the report structure change in the canvas.\n\n\nDrilling down across data sources\n\n\nIf you want to nest records from a different data source within records from the report's base data source,\nyou'll need to add at least one grouping for the base data source first, then add a second grouping beneath\nthat.  In the second grouping, you'll have the option to choose a different data source.\n\n\nWhen you change the data source to something other than \"Use rows from parent group,\" you'll need to specify\nhow to select records from the second data source.  Choose the fields from the child and parent data source\nthat contains values that must match in order to pull in records for that parent row.\n\n\nFor example, if you have a base data source listing branch offices, you might do as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a top grouping level that groups by \"OfficeID\" -- this will give you one group per branch office, since the OfficeID is unique for each office\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a sub-grouping that uses a different data source, \"Employees\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the sub-grouping's filter fields as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse data: [Employees] where [EmployeeOfficeID] equals parent's [OfficeID]\n\n\nThis says that for each office (top-level grouping), you want to pull in records from Employees where the employee's\nEmployeeOfficeID (this field must exist in the Employees data source) matches the OfficeID in the outer\ndata source.\n\n\nDetail section\n\n\nBy default, the detail section lists each record from the data source.  If you have not set up a grouping that pulls\ndata from a second data source, then the detail records come from the report's base data source (chosen in the \nData Source selector).  If you did create a sub-grouping with a second data source, detail records will come from\nthat data source.\n\n\nYou can hide the detail section by un-checking \"Show detail section.\"\n\n\nYou can also specify the ordering of detail rows.\n\n\nThe Inputs tab\n\n\nThis tab allows you to define inputs (parameters) for the report.  For example, you might want to define a\nreport that summarizes sales for a time period, but you'd like to specify the time period when you run the report,\nwithout having to redesign the report.\n\n\nTo implement that example, you would add two inputs under the Inputs tab, named StartDate and EndDate, set to type \"Date.\"\n\n\n\n\nThen, back in the Data \n Groups tab, create two filters that limit the report to rows within the range specified by the two inputs you created:\n\n\n\n\nThe Page tab\n\n\nThe Page tab allows you to define the layout of the report on the printed page.\n\n\nYou can choose either inches or millimeters (mm) as the base units for your report.  The page dimensions and\nmargins will be specified in terms of the units you choose.\n\n\nBy default, the page will be US Letter size (8.5 x 11 inches).\n\n\nTo change the paper size, choose a new option from the drop-down.\n\n\nPage header and footer\n\n\nThe report can have a page header and footer that appear only in print mode (PDF), on each page.\n\n\nUse the \"page header and footer\" checkboxes to turn on or off the page header and footer.\n\n\nWithin the page header and footer on the report canvas, you can use special syntax in text elements to\nprint the page number and page count.  For example, the expression\n\n\nThis is page [PAGE_NUMBER] of [PAGE_COUNT]\n\n\n\nResults in:\n\n\nThis is page 1 of 27\n\n\n\n\n\nElement types\n\n\nText element\n\n\n\n\nThe most common report element.  Displays either static (fixed) text like a report title or dynamic, data-driven\ntext using expressions.\n\n\nInserting data fields\n\n\nUse square brackets around the name of the data field to insert the field value:\n\n\nThe employee's name is [FirstName] [LastName].\n\n\n\nTotals\n\n\nIn a header or footer section, for a group or for the entire report, you can use expressions to compute totals\nover all the values in the group.\n\n\nThere are [SUM(Hours)] total in this time period for \n[COUNT(EmployeeID)] employees, for an average of [AVERAGE(Hours)] hours \nper employee.\n\n\n\nCalculations\n\n\nTo calculate a value from data fields, use square brackets and an equals sign, followed by the expression.  Note that the field names inside the expression do not have square brackets around them individually.\n\n\nThe total amount billed was [=Hours * Billing_rate].\n\n\n\nFormatting numbers and dates\n\n\nYou can apply a format to a numeric or date value.  Click the gear menu icon at the right edge of the element\ntoolbar and look for the Pattern property.  Here are some examples of patterns you can enter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPattern\n\n\nApplies to\n\n\nExample output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$#,##0.00\n\n\nNumber\n\n\n$123,456.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#,##0\n\n\nNumber\n\n\n1,234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM/D/YYYY\n\n\nDate\n\n\n9/1/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMM/DD/YYYY\n\n\nDate\n\n\n09/01/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndddd, MMM D, YYYY h:mm a\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTuesday, Sep 1, 2015 8:56 am\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChart element\n\n\n\n\nDisplays a chart generated from the values in a grouping.  Supported types are line, bar, and pie charts.\n\n\nThe chart control supports charting a single data series.  The data values come from the value field you specify.\nFor line and bar charts, the label field provides the X-axis labels.  For pie charts, the label field appears in\nthe legend.\n\n\nChart elements must be placed in a header or footer section, because they operate on grouped values.  When a chart\nis placed in a report header or footer, the chart works on all records in the report.\n\n\nPicture element\n\n\n\n\nEmbeds an image in the report.  The set of available images is provided by the application developer.\n\n\nBox element\n\n\n\n\nA rectangle, useful for outlining or highlighting areas of the report.\n\n\nBarcode element\n\n\n\n\nA barcode that can encode values from your data source.  Several types of barcode are available, including QR code, UPC, and Code 39, and others.\n\n\nLike the Text element, the Barcode element allows free-form values to be encoded, including data fields from your data source.  Use the same expression syntax you would use for Text elements.\n\n\nWorking with elements\n\n\nAdding elements to the report\n\n\nTo add an element, click and drag from the element palette above the canvas onto the canvas.\n\n\nRemoving elements from the report\n\n\nTo remove an element, click on it to select it, then either press the \nDelete\n key on your keyboard or click the\nX that appears above the element.  You can delete multiple elements at once by \nselecting multiple elements\n and then\npressing the \nDelete\n key.\n\n\nMoving and resizing elements\n\n\nClick once on an element in the canvas to select it.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting multiple elements\n\n\nTo select multiple elements, hold the \nCtrl\n key (on Windows) or the \nCmd\n key (on Mac) and single-click each\nelement to add it to the selection.  After you've selected all the elements you want, release the \nCtrl\n/\nCmd\n key.\n\n\nWhen you have multiple elements selected, you can drag them all together by dragging any one of the elements as you would normally -- the other elements will move along with it.\n\n\nCopying and pasting elements\n\n\nSelect one or more elements and press \nCtrl+C\n (Windows) or \nCmd+C\n (Mac) to copy the selection.  Then press \nCtrl+V\n (Windows) or \nCmd+V\n (Mac) to paste a copy of the selection.  The pasted elements will be selected and you can drag them to a new location as a group.\n\n\nDragging elements and snapping to the grid\n\n\nNormally, as you drag elements on the canvas, they will snap to a grid to help you line elements up cleanly.  To\noverride that behavior and position elements at a pixel-precise level, hold the \nCtrl\n key (Windows) or \nCmd\n key (Mac) while dragging.\n\n\nPivot (cross-tab) reports\n\n\nYou can generate columns out of rows in your data source using the pivot feature.  For example, you can\ncreate a column for each month based on the values in a date field.  In the designer, you set up a single\ncolumn and choose which field in your data source contains the values that define the columns.  When the\nreport runs, the column is repeated, once for each distinct value in that field in the data source, and\nany elements in that column are evaluated against only those rows matching that column's value.\n\n\nEnabling the pivot feature\n\n\nFirst, check the \"Enable pivot\" checkbox in the Data \n Groups tab in the designer.\n\n\nYou'll see three vertical lines appear in the canvas to the right.  These define the pivot column and how it\nwill be rendered when the report runs.  You can move these lines by clicking and dragging with the mouse.\n\n\nChoosing a pivot field\n\n\nSet the \"Pivot field\" setting to the field in your data source that contains the values that \ndefine the columns.  In our example, we want a column for each month, so we set the pivot field to the\ndate field in our data source.\n\n\nChoose a bucket type (optional)\n\n\nOur data source contains specific dates (each row records a sale on a specific day) but we don't want\na column for each day, only for each month.  So we tell jsreports to group all values for the same month\ninto a single pivot column by selecting the \"month\" bucket type.  Bucket type is only applicable for\ndate-type fields.\n\n\nArranging the pivot column and area\n\n\nThe three vertical lines define two areas in the report.  The left side (not shaded) is the pivot column.\nAny content in this area will be cloned when the report runs, once for each distinct pivot value.  For example,\nif you're pivoting based on a date field and your bucket type is \"month,\" you'll get one column per month\nin the data source.  In the screenshot below, we've set up a column that has a header and a text element in\nthe detail section.\n\n\n\n\nThe right-hand (shaded) area defines room reserved for the generated columns when the report runs.  All\ncolumns will be shown regardless of whether you reserve enough space; the reserved space simply helps you\nvisualize the final output and know where not to place other controls so they won't overlap with the pivot\ncolumns.  Cloned elements will be shown in the reserved area to simulate the additional columns.\n\n\nWhich elements are cloned when the report runs?\n\n\nOnly elements that lie entirely within the pivot column (the left, unshaded side of the pivot region)\nare cloned.\n\n\nWhat about elements that span the pivot area horizontally?\n\n\nIf you place an element so that its left edge is to the left of the pivot column and its right edge is to the\nright of the shaded reserved area, that element's width will be increased so that it spans all of the generated\ncolumns.\n\n\nWhat happens when there are too many columns to fit in the reserved space?\n\n\nWhen there are more values in the data source than fit in the reserved area, jsreports will expand the pivot\narea rightward to fit the extra columns.  When rendering a report to the screen, the area will expand and a\nhorizontal scrollbar will appear if needed.  In print mode (PDF), the page width will be increased to fit\nall content onto a single page.\n\n\nUsing data in the pivot column\n\n\nAll element types can be used as usual in the pivot column.  However, you should treat any element in a\npivot column as if it were in a group header or footer, because the pivot column represents a set of values\ngrouped together (for example, all rows for a given month).  Therefore, you should usually use aggregate\nfunctions instead of referring to a field by itself.  For example, in the pivot cell you should usually use\n\n\n[SUM(\nmy_field_name\n)]\n\n\n\nto total all the values for that month.  \n\n\nThe column header is an exception to this rule.  If you refer to a field name\nwithout an aggregate function in a column header, you'll get a single value from one of the rows matching that column, but which row is unpredictable.  So if your report is pivoted by a date field with bucketing by month, you could write\n\n\n[\nmy_date_field_name\n]\n\n\n\nin a text element in the column header, set its Pattern property to 'MM/YY' to get the month and year for\nthat column.  Since all values in the column have the same month and year, you'll get a predictable result.",

However, you should treat any element in a\npivot column as if it were in a group header or footer, because the pivot column represents a set of values\ngrouped together (for example, all rows for a given month).  Therefore, you should usually use aggregate\nfunctions instead of referring to a field by itself.  For example, in the pivot cell you should usually use  [SUM( my_field_name )]  to total all the values for that month.    The column header is an exception to this rule.  If you refer to a field name\nwithout an aggregate function in a column header, you'll get a single value from one of the rows matching that column, but which row is unpredictable.  So if your report is pivoted by a date field with bucketing by month, you could write  [ my_date_field_name ]  in a text element in the column header, set its Pattern property to 'MM/YY' to get the month and year for\nthat column.  Since all values in the column have the same month and year, you'll get a predictable result.",
